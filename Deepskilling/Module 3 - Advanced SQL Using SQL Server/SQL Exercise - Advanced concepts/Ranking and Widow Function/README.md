Assignment 3 — SQL Ranking & Window Functions
Overview
This assignment demonstrates SQL Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), used with OVER() and PARTITION BY to find the top 3 most expensive products per category — without collapsing rows like GROUP BY would.

What is a Window Function?
A window function performs a calculation across a set of rows related to the current row (the "window"), without collapsing them into a single output row. Unlike GROUP BY, each source row still appears in the result.

FUNCTION_NAME() OVER (
    PARTITION BY column   -- defines the "window" / groups
    ORDER BY column DESC  -- defines the order within the window
)
Sample Data — Products Table
ProductID	ProductName	Category	Price
1	Laptop Pro 15	Electronics	1500.00
5	Monitor 27"	Electronics	450.00
3	Mechanical Keyboard	Electronics	120.00
7	Standing Desk	Furniture	600.00
6	Desk Chair Ergo	Furniture	350.00
13	Design Patterns	Books	55.00
14	The Pragmatic Programmer	Books	50.00
15	SICP	Books	50.00
...	...	...	...
Note: "The Pragmatic Programmer" and "SICP" both cost $50 — a deliberate tie to show ranking differences.

The Three Ranking Functions
ROW_NUMBER()
Assigns a unique sequential number — ties get different numbers.

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC)
ProductName	Price	RowNum
Design Patterns	55.00	1
The Pragmatic Prog	50.00	2
SICP	50.00	3 ← unique even though same price
Python Cookbook	45.00	4
RANK()
Ties get the same rank; the next rank skips (leaves a gap).

RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC)
ProductName	Price	RankNum
Design Patterns	55.00	1
The Pragmatic Prog	50.00	2
SICP	50.00	2 ← same rank
Python Cookbook	45.00	4 ← skips 3
DENSE_RANK()
Ties get the same rank; the next rank does NOT skip.

DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC)
ProductName	Price	DenseRank
Design Patterns	55.00	1
The Pragmatic Prog	50.00	2
SICP	50.00	2 ← same rank
Python Cookbook	45.00	3 ← no gap
Quick Comparison Table
Scenario	ROW_NUMBER	RANK	DENSE_RANK
Ties allowed?	No (always unique)	Yes	Yes
Gap after tie?	N/A	Yes	No
Use when…	Need unique IDs	Sports leaderboard	Exam percentile grades
Top 3 per Category — Final Query (CTE pattern)
WITH RankedProducts AS (
    SELECT
        Category, ProductName, Price,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS DenseRank
    FROM Products
)
SELECT * FROM RankedProducts WHERE DenseRank <= 3
ORDER BY Category, DenseRank;
Expected Output
Category	ProductName	Price	DenseRank
Books	Design Patterns	55.00	1
Books	The Pragmatic Prog	50.00	2
Books	SICP	50.00	2
Books	Python Cookbook	45.00	3
Electronics	Laptop Pro 15	1500.00	1
Electronics	Monitor 27"	450.00	2
Electronics	Mechanical Keyboard	120.00	3
Furniture	Standing Desk	600.00	1
Furniture	Desk Chair Ergo	350.00	2
Furniture	Bookshelf Oak	200.00	3
Using DENSE_RANK with <= 3 means both tied $50 books appear — neither is unfairly excluded.

How to Run
Paste the contents of window_functions.sql into any SQL client:

SQL Server: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio
PostgreSQL: pgAdmin or psql
MySQL 8+: MySQL Workbench (window functions supported from v8.0)
SQLite: DB Browser for SQLite (v3.25+)
Online: https://sqliteonline.com or https://sqlfiddle.com
Run each query block separately (separated by the -- comment headers) to see each step's output.
